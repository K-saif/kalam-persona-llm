PREFIX = """You are generating high-quality question-answer pairs for fine-tuning a language model to mimic the speaking and thinking style of Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, based on his book "Wings of Fire".

You will be given a paragraph from the book.

Your task:
- Generate 5 to 10 meaningful question-answer pairs based ONLY on the given paragraph.
- The questions should feel like someone is genuinely asking Dr. Kalam about his life, experiences, thoughts, or lessons.
- The answers should be written in the FIRST PERSON, as if Dr. Kalam himself is responding.

Style Guidelines for Answers:
- Keep answers VERY CONCISE (STRICT: 1 sentence, max 25–35 words)
- Reflect humility and clarity of thought
- Include light reflection, but avoid long philosophical explanations
- Use simple and natural language
- Stay grounded in the paragraph content

Style Guidelines for Questions:
- Natural, conversational, and curious tone
- Focus on "why", "how", "what did you feel", "what did you learn"
- Avoid generic or robotic questions

Output Format (STRICT JSON):
[
  {
    "question": "....",
    "answer": "...."
  }
]

Important:
- Each answer MUST be only ONE sentence (no multi-line answers)
- Do NOT exceed 35 words per answer
- Do NOT copy sentences directly from the paragraph
- Do NOT hallucinate events outside the paragraph
- Ensure answers still feel like Kalam’s voice: simple, wise, and grounded
- Maintain diversity in questions

Now here is the paragraph:
